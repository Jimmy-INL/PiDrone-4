##How does it work? 
The Multiwii controller looks after my 4 motors and distributes power to supply them. The Rasberry Pi collects the information who came from the smartphone and relay them to the Multiwii. 

##Installation
I will not cover the installation of the hardware installation of the quadcopter, just the software installation on the Rasberry Pi.
