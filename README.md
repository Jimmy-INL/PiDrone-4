# PIDrone
A quadcopter powered by a Multiwii flight controller and are controlled with a Rasberry Pi 2 B. The Rasberry Pi runs Node.js which controls the Multiwii flight controller. It also uses <a href="https://socket.io/">socket.io</a> to connect to the android app that you can use as a remote control. 

## How does it work? 
The Multiwii controller looks after my 4 motors and distributes power to supply them. The Rasberry Pi collects the information who came from the smartphone and relay them to the Multiwii.
